This repository contains all code needed to replicate the training, testing, and plotting procedures specified in the paper "STAMNet - A Spatiotemporal Attention Module and Network for Upscaling Reactive Transport Simulations of the Hyporheic Zone". All code is contained in the "Notebooks" folder. For data used train the models, please contact marc berghouse at marc.berghouse@gmail.com

The main training and testing procedure, as well as the Pytorch class definitions for STAM, STAMNet-upscale, and STAMNet-upsample, can be seen in the STAMNet_upscaling_clean.ipynb file. A more complete, but less organized version of this file is called STAMNet_upscaling_all_code.ipynb. The initial generation of heterogeneous permeability fields is shown in the gstools_perm_clean.ipynb file. The format_input_files.ipynb file contains all the logic used to vary the parameters of each simulation in order to create our training and testing datasets. The Biomass_sensitivity.ipynb file contains figures showing the results of various sensitivity analyses on our simulated data of biomass growth in the hyporheic zone. All other files relate to some kind of model exploration that was ultimately not featured in the final paper or earlier version of the final STAMNet notebooks.
